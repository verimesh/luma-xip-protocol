# XIP Protocol — ISO 20022 Mapping
**Version:** v1.0.1  
**Document:** 03-XIP-ISO20022-Mapping  
**Status:** Released

---

## 1. Overview

This document defines how **XIP (eXtensible Integrity Protocol)** receipts map to **ISO 20022** financial message structures for regulated, sovereign, and institutional environments.

The mapping enables:

- Regulator-ready transaction exports  
- CBDC and regulated stablecoin audit support  
- Offline-to-online financial reconciliation  
- XRPL and distributed ledger settlement evidence  
- Government and institutional financial oversight  

XIP integrates cleanly with ISO 20022 due to its **deterministic receipt format**, **hash-chained audit model**, and **zero-knowledge metadata design**.

---

## 2. Role of ISO 20022

ISO 20022 is the global standard for financial messaging and is used by:

- SWIFT  
- SEPA  
- Central banks  
- Payment service providers  
- Financial regulators  
- Clearing and settlement networks  

By supporting ISO 20022 exports, XIP allows institutions to:

- Interoperate with existing banking rails  
- Audit offline financial events after reconnection  
- Integrate XIP into national payment infrastructures  
- Maintain regulatory continuity during outages or degraded connectivity  

---

## 3. Architectural Positioning

XIP **does not replace** ISO 20022.

Instead, XIP operates as a **cryptographic audit and integrity layer**, while ISO 20022 remains the **semantic and transport messaging standard**.

Each XIP receipt is embedded inside ISO-compliant message envelopes (`MX` messages) using the standard **`SplmtryData`** extension mechanism.

This ensures:
- Zero disruption to existing infrastructure  
- Full backward compatibility  
- Clear separation of concerns  

---

## 4. Mapping Scope

XIP receipts may be exported into ISO 20022 message families covering:

- Payments  
- Remittances  
- CBDC and stablecoin movements  
- Merchant transactions  
- Invoice lifecycle events  
- Government disbursements  
- Regulatory and supervisory reporting

## 5. Core Field Mapping

| XIP Field | ISO 20022 Element | Notes |
|---------|------------------|------|
| `timestamp` | `GrpHdr/CreDtTm` | UTC timestamp |
| `hub_id` | `AppHdr/MsgDefIdr` | Application or hub domain |
| `device_id` | `InitgPty/Id/OrgId/Othr/Id` | Non-personal device identifier |
| `event` | `Document/*` | Message-specific payload |
| `prev_hash` | `SplmtryData/Envlp/XIPPrevHash` | Hash-chain continuity |
| `signature` | `SplmtryData/Envlp/XIPSignature` | Cryptographic signature |
| `ledger_ref` | `SplmtryData/Envlp/XIPLedgerRef` | Optional ledger reference |
| `version` | `AppHdr/Fr` or `SplmtryData` | XIP protocol version |

All XIP-specific data is contained within **`SplmtryData`**, leaving core financial semantics untouched.

## 6. Example — Payment Event (`pacs.008`)

```xml
<FIToFICstmrCdtTrf>
  <GrpHdr>
    <CreDtTm>2025-12-03T14:12:11Z</CreDtTm>
  </GrpHdr>
  <CdtTrfTxInf>
    <PmtId>
      <EndToEndId>...</EndToEndId>
    </PmtId>
    <SplmtryData>
      <Envlp>
        <XIPPrevHash>...</XIPPrevHash>
        <XIPSignature>...</XIPSignature>
        <XIPLedgerRef>...</XIPLedgerRef>
      </Envlp>
    </SplmtryData>
  </CdtTrfTxInf>
</FIToFICstmrCdtTrf>
Design principle:
XIP metadata is embedded without altering ISO 20022 payment structures.

7. Verification Process

To verify an ISO 20022 message containing XIP data:

Extract SplmtryData

Reconstruct the XIP hash chain

Verify cryptographic signatures

Validate ordering and continuity

Apply financial or regulatory logic

Auditors may verify:

Offline transaction history

Multi-device receipt merges

Welfare and subsidy payments

CBDC and stablecoin settlement evidence

Merchant and government audit trails

8. Distributed Ledger Alignment (Non-Normative)

XIP supports optional linkage to distributed ledgers, including the XRP Ledger (XRPL), via the ledger_ref field.

Where used:

ISO 20022 handles institutional messaging

XIP provides tamper-proof event evidence

Distributed ledgers provide settlement or notarisation

Ledger usage is:

Optional

Non-mandatory

Ledger-agnostic

Regulator-controlled

9. Benefits of ISO 20022 Integration

Compatible with global financial rails

No changes required to banking infrastructure

Supports CBDCs and regulated stablecoins

Preserves XIP audit-chain integrity

Enables cross-border regulatory reporting

Bridges offline activity with online settlement

10. Conclusion

XIP integrates with ISO 20022 using the standard SplmtryData extension mechanism.

This enables offline-first, cryptographically verifiable receipts to be exported directly into existing global financial and regulatory systems without infrastructure modification.

This mapping is foundational for:

Government payment platforms

National financial infrastructures

CBDC and stablecoin issuers

Financial regulators and auditors

Cross-border compliance systems
